/**
 * tl;dr:
 * This is a wrapper that temporarily hijacks React history.
 * 
 * More details:
 * _history_, which is used by _React Router_ (`HashRouter`
 * in App.js), runs the function `getConfirmation()` every
 * time the user navigates away from a React 'page'.
 * Navigates to a different `Route`, that is. This is useful
 * for adding `onunload`-like prompts.
 * 
 * We could do this in a way that would be persistent
 * throughout the site, but that became too hard to follow.
 * Instead we pass it down through `props`. When we're done
 * hijacking, we restore the old history behavior. We only
 * really use the non-default behavior, but we figure it's
 * probably good practice to restore the default behavior
 * when we're done with our special case.
