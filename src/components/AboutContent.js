      <Header as='h3'>What is this?</Header>
      <p>This tool can help show how a change in income affects how much someone receives in public assistance from SNAP and Section 8 Housing Voucher benefits. It was designed for the case managers at <ExternalLink href='http://www.prohope.org/'>Project Hope</ExternalLink> with the aim of helping to predict changes in their client's benefits.</p>

      <Header as='h3'>Why are you doing this?</Header>
      <p>When a slight change in a household’s circumstances - say, a slight pay raise - disproportionately lowers their benefits, that’s called a “cliff effect”. The household is working to increase what they earn, but they end up with a net loss that actually puts them further behind. These “cliff effects” prevent many families from actually getting off of public assistance programs.</p>
      <p>Cliff effects are also very hard to predict. The interactions between income, household size, many other criteria, and the effects of the programs themselves impact each other in unexpected ways. We're exploring ways to deal with this issue of complexity and help families better understand and predict their situation.</p>

      <Header as='h3'>How do I use this tool?</Header>
      <p>Go step-by-step to add information about a client's current benefits, household, income, and other relevant information. This information will be used to predict the client's approximate benefit amount. When you reach the end, change the 'Future Income' amount to see how a change in earned income will cause a change in benefit amount. Currently, the SNAP and Section 8 Housing Voucher programs are both available. Note that predictions may not directly match up with a client’s current benefit amount. The app’s focus is the amount of change that occurs in benefits when there are changes in earned income.</p>
