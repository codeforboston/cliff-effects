* @todo IS THIS RUNNING AS IF FROM A SERVER ON GH-PAGES BRANCH?
* "If you use it on server, call ReactRedirect.rewind() after
* rendering components to string to retrieve the redirect location
* given to the innermost ReactRedirect. You can then embed this
* title into HTML page template.
* Because this component keeps track of mounted instances, you have
* to make sure to call rewind on server, or you'll get a memory leak."
* @todo For some reason, when clicking 'back' on the project hope
* page, you have to go back twice to get back to our page. I've tried
* this elsewhere (like from issue #11) and it doesn't happen. Is this
* a local development issue? A running-on-a-server issue? Both tests
* were on Chrome v60.0.3112.113
