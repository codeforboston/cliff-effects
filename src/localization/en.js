      `This tool can help show how a change in income affects how much someone receives in public assistance from SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) and Section 8 Housing Voucher benefits. It was designed for the case managers at `,

    whyHeader_v1: `Why is this tool important?`,
    why1_v1:      `A cliff effect occurs when a slight change in a household’s circumstances - say, a slight pay raise - disproportionately lowers their benefits. The household is working to increase what they earn, but they end up with a net loss that actually puts them further behind. These cliff effects prevent many families from actually getting off of public assistance programs.`,
    why2_v1:      `Cliff effects are also difficult to predict. The interactions between income, household size, many other criteria, as well as the effects of the programs themselves impact each other in unexpected ways. We're exploring ways to deal with this issue of complexity and help families better understand and predict their situation.`,

This information will be used to predict the client's approximate benefit amount.

Currently, the SNAP and Section 8 Housing Voucher programs are both available. Note that predictions may not directly match up with a client’s current benefit amount. The app’s focus is the amount of change that occurs in benefits when there are changes in earned income.`,
