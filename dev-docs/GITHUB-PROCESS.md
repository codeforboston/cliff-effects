# Github Process

To get yourself set up to keep up to date with the latest changes to the `dev` branch, make sure you've gone through [Step 3 of the github guide](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/#step-3-configure-git-to-sync-your-fork-with-the-original-spoon-knife-repository). To keep your branches from getting tangled as you both make changes and keep up to date with our repo, take a look at our wiki page about a possible [Github workflow](https://github.com/codeforboston/cliff-effects/wiki/Guide:-Github-Workflow).
